*其他语言版本： [简体中文](README.zh.md)*

The Agora OpenDuo sample app supports the following platforms:

* [iOS](https://github.com/AgoraIO/OpenDuo-iOS-Objective-C)
* [Android](https://github.com/AgoraIO/OpenDuo-Android)
* [Web](https://github.com/AgoraIO/OpenDuo-Web)

This readme describes the steps and considerations for demonstrating the Agora OpenDuo sample app.

## Introduction

Built upon the Agora Video SDK and the Agora Signaling SDK, the Agora OpenDuo for Android is an open-source demo that integrates video chat into your Android applications.

This sample app allows you to:

- Login the signaling server
- Inquire whether the calling subscriber is online
- Call each other
- Accept or hang up a call
- Mute/unmute a user
- Switch camera

## Developer Environment Requirements

- Android Studio 2.0 or later
- Real Android devices, for example Nexus 5X

NOTE: Agora recommends using a real device instead of a simulator, because some simulators are inadequate and hence may cause issues. 

## Running the App
1. Create a developer account at [Agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/), and obtain an App ID. 
   
   NOTE: For more information, see [Obtaining an App ID](https://docs.agora.io/en/2.2/addons/Signaling/Agora%20Basics/key_signaling?platform=All%20Platforms)
   
2. Fill in your App ID in the **app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml**.

 
        <string name="agora_app_id"><#YOUR APP ID#></string>

3. Download the Agora video SDK and the Agora signaling SDK from [Agora.io SDK](https://www.agora.io/en/download/). 

   NOTE: This project is built upon the **Agora Video SDK 2.1.0** and the **Agora Signaling SDK 1.2.1**.

4. Unzip the downloaded SDK package and: 

  - copy ***.jar** under **/libs** to **app/libs**
  - copy **arm64-v8a**/**x86**/**armeabi-v7a** under **libs** to **app/src/main/jniLibs**.

5. Check whether the following code snippet is in the property of the dependence of **app/build.gradle** (the current sample app already has it):

          compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])

6. Use Android Studio to open the project, connect your Android device to your computer, and build and run the sample app.

   NOTE: You can also use `Gradle` to build and run the sample app.
